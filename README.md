This work is part of a coursework done by Matheus Gil Torloni in the University of Manchester 2024. 
The m-files above were used to create and analyse a chase through ODEs using MATLAB's ODE solver ode45 (as required by the lecturer).
Detailed explanations,as well as the model's limitations can also be found in this [report](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18604997/Report.predator-prey.ODEs.pdf).
